<h2>The data</h2>

<p>It is from an experiment to determine human activity using smartphone data. 
This info comes directly from the help file:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See &#39;features_info.txt&#39; for more details.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>The variables</h2>

<p>For each record it is provided:</p>

<p>1.Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.</p>

<p>2.Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.</p>

<p>3.A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.</p>

<p>4.Its activity label.</p>

<p>5.An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.</p>

<h2>The transformations</h2>

<p>The run_analysis.R script performs the following activities:</p>

<p>1.Adds all the necessary files to R using read.table</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>features.txt</strong>: List of all features.</li>
<li><strong>activity_labels.txt</strong>: Links the class labels with their activity name.</li>
<li><strong>train/X_train.txt</strong>: Training set.</li>
<li><strong>train/y_train.txt</strong>: Training labels.</li>
<li><strong>test/X_test.txt</strong>: Test set.</li>
<li><strong>test/y_test.txt</strong>: Test labels.</li>
</ul>

<p>2.Merge the training and test sets</p>

<p>3.Calculates means and standard deviations of each feature. it saves the results in a file called <strong>meansAndStdev.txt</strong></p>

<p>4.Combines all the activity labels, subjects, and features in one data set called <strong>Accelerometer.data</strong></p>

<p>5.With this dataset, I used the <em>aggregate</em> function to calculate the means for each activity and subject. The script produces a file called <strong>FeatureMeansBySubjectAndActivity.txt</strong> that it is the one uploaded in the assignment page and you can see it as well in the repo.</p>
